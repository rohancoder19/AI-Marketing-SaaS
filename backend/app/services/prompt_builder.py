Generate exactly {req.num_variations} variations of a social media post in a valid, parsable JSON format.

Input Parameters:
- Topic: {req.topic}
- Description: {req.description}
- Campaign Goal: {req.campaign_goal}
- Target Platform: {req.platform}
- Writing Tone: {req.tone}
- Target Audience: {req.target_audience}

Formatting Instructions:
1. {platform_guide}
2. {length_guide}
3. {emoji_guide}
4. {cta_instruction}
5. {hashtag_instruction}
6. Provide a 'character_count' field which represents the length of the hook + caption + cta combined.
7. Provide a 'reading_time' estimation (e.g. '12s', '5s', '35s') based on standard reading speed of 200 words per minute.

Strict JSON Response Format:
Your output must be a single JSON object (with no markdown wrappers, no backticks, no markdown formatting fences, and no text before or after the JSON). The JSON must conform exactly to this schema:
{{
  "posts": [
    {{
      "hook": "An attention-grabbing first line or hook.",
      "caption": "The main body/caption of the post matching the tone and length instructions.",
      "cta": "The call to action text (leave empty string if include_cta is false).",
      "hashtags": ["list", "of", "hashtags"] (leave empty list if include_hashtags is false),
      "character_count": 180 (integer representing the character count of hook+caption+cta),
      "reading_time": "12s" (string representing reading time)
    }}
  ]
}}

Generate exactly {req.num_variations} variations inside the 'posts' array. Return ONLY the JSON object.
